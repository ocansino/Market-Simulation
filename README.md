# Market-Simulation
This program simulates the weekly performance of the SP500 from 1950-2018 using Linear, Distributional, and Monte Carlo methods of simulation. The program then compares the performance of the SP500 to its historical performance and returns statistical data such as Min, Max, Mean, Median, and Std Dev of each method used.
